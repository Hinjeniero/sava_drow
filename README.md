TO START THE GAME: 'python.exe main.py' in command line
DEPENDENCIES: pygame, numpy, wrapt

TODO TODAY:
    1.- Organize source files
    2.- Exit dialog in menus/board, finish it and connect it to game events.
    3.- Make animated sprites loop backwards if requested (In an input argument of the constructor).
    4.- Start server-client connection (reverse-engineer the examples in MasterMind library).

TODO WHENEVER:
    1.- Make graphics for the sliders.
    2.- Create animated graphics for menu sprites when active? Can't reuse surfaces, since they blit text to them.
    3.- Implement spider dice + sprite. Needs to randomize the game a little bit.
