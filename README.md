TO START THE GAME: 'python.exe main.py' in command line
DEPENDENCIES: pygame, numpy, wrapt

TODO CURRENT:
    1.- Start server-client connection (reverse-engineer the examples in MasterMind library - 100%).
    2.- Make your server-clint thing already (~40%)
    3.- Implement spider dice + sprite. Needs to randomize the game a little bit.
    4.- Set game between separete computers (Over LAN or something)

TODO WHENEVER:
    1.- Make graphics for the sliders.
    2.- Create animated graphics for menu sprites when active? Can't reuse surfaces, since they blit text to them.
