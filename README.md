TO START THE GAME: 'python.exe main.py' in command line
DEPENDENCIES: pygame, numpy, wrapt

TODO CURRENT:
    1.- Make your server-clint thing already (~95%)
    2.- Implement spider dice + sprite. Needs to randomize the game a little bit.

TODO WHENEVER:
    1.- Make graphics for the sliders.
    1.5.- Promotion of chars when reaching adequate cell
    2.- Create animated graphics for menu sprites when active? Can't reuse surfaces, since they blit text to them.
