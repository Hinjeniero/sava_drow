    Has an animated sprite that moves accross different positions on the screen,
    all with a previous calculated 'script' of positions at each time.
    In short, each of the components of a cutscene or animation. Each of the sprites.
    Attributes:
        starting_position(:tuple: int, int):    Initial position of the sprite. Will return to it
                                                when it ends moving around.
        frames(:dict: list...): List of all the positions in each frame (following the current fps rate).
                                Is calculated beforehand. Each key is the fps rate. #TODO complete this attribute.
        index(int): Current position(frame) that the sprite is in.    
        fps(int):   Frames per second of the animation.
        fps_modes(:tuple: int...):  The different frames per second refresh rates
                                    that we want the Sprite to be ready for.
        frame_jump(int):    Jump of frames in each drawing. Normally is 1, to follow all the frames. 
                            If we want the sprite to speed up we can increase this value, thus skipping frames.
        time(float):    Duration of the actions of the sprite (The spotlight time of this sprite). In seconds.
        init_time(float):   The time in seconds at which this sprite animation starts. It's used when added to an animation.
        end_time(float):   The time in seconds at which this sprite animation ends. It's used when added to an animation.
